Some common utility functions and helpers. I am currently pulling them from repos I've used at work so will be converting them over to Typescript and adding tests as I go.

## Current packages:

- `contains` - Checks if a character is within a string.
- `class-list` - Helpers classList operations.
- `prop-injector` - Wrapper to assign contextual props to child.
